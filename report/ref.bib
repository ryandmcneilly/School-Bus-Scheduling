  abstract = {This paper introduces a school bus scheduling problem wherein trips for each school are given. A trip consists of a sequence of bus stops and their designated school. Each school has its fixed time window within which trips should be completed. A school bus can serve multiple trips for multiple schools. The school bus scheduling problem seeks to optimize bus schedules to serve all the given trips considering the school time windows. We first model the problem as a vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) by treating a trip as a virtual stop. Two assignment problem based exact approaches are then proposed for special cases and a heuristic algorithm is proposed for more general cases. Benchmark problems and computational experiments are presented. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}
